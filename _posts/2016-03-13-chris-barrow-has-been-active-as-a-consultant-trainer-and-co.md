# About Me

Chris Barrow has been active as a consultant, trainer and coach to the UK dental profession for over 23 years. 

Naturally direct, assertive and determined, he has the ability to reach conclusions quickly, as well as the sharp reflexes and lightness of touch to innovate, change tack and push boundaries. 

As a speaker he is dynamic, energetic and charismatic. 

Chris spent the first 17 years of his working life in the corporate sector and followed this with 29 years of self-employment. The different dynamics of both worlds have given him the valuable gift of knowing how to operate -- and communicate -- in both. 

In 1987 Chris was active in the establishment of the Institute for Financial Planning, an organisation representing the first fee-based Financial Planners; Chris specialised in working with small businesses. 

In 1993 Chris decided to make the transition to business coaching and became one of the first UK students at Coach University, from where he graduated as a certified coach. 

Recognising the opportunity in the dental profession, 1997 saw the creation of The Dental Business School (DBS) and the development of a 12-month business coaching programme for dental practice owners and their teams, delivered to over 1,000 UK dental practices in the following 10 years. 

Chris acts as an occasional Non-Executive Director for dental micro-corporates as well as continuing his freelance consultancy work for independent practices.

His main focus now is on 7connections, a privately-owned company that provides coaching and mentorship in independent dentistry and also provides Digital Marketing training and support services to clients.
